<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, and welcome to my space on the web. My name is Mohammed Firas,
  and I’m passionate about blending creativity with technology to build meaningful experiences,
  solve real-world problems, and continue growing both professionally and personally.
</p>

<p>
  I come from a background in computer engineering,
  with a strong interest in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence,
  software development, and digital systems design.
  I believe in lifelong learning and continuously challenge myself with new projects that push the limits of what I know.
</p>

<p>
  Whether I’m working on a coding project, analyzing hardware performance,
  or writing reports that explain complex concepts in simple terms,
  I always aim for clarity, precision, and impact.
  I'm not just a tech enthusiast—I care about how technology interacts with people,
  and how we can use it to improve lives and build a smarter, more sustainable future.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of engineering, I enjoy fitness training, exploring tech gadgets,
  and diving into anything that sparks creativity—be it music, design, or writing.
</p>

<p>
  This website is a reflection of who I am and what I do. Here you’ll find my latest projects,
  articles, and insights into my journey as I continue to learn, create, and evolve.
